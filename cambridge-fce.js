     passage:"When Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989, he could hardly have imagined how profoundly it would reshape human civilisation. Working at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory in Switzerland, Berners-Lee was simply trying to make it easier for scientists to share research papers. His solution involved combining hypertext with the internet to create a system where documents could be linked together and accessed from anywhere in the world. The first website went live in 1991, and within just a few years, the web had exploded into mainstream use. By the mid-1990s, companies were racing to establish an online presence, and the dot-com boom was in full swing. Some of these early ventures, such as Amazon and eBay, would go on to become global giants. Others, however, collapsed spectacularly when the bubble burst in 2000. What is remarkable about Berners-Lee is that he chose not to patent his invention. He could easily have become one of the wealthiest people on the planet, but he believed that the web should remain open and free for everyone. This decision was instrumental in allowing the rapid growth and democratisation of the internet. Today, Berners-Lee continues to campaign for digital rights and an open web, warning against the concentration of power in the hands of a few large technology corporations. He has expressed concern about the spread of misinformation, the erosion of privacy, and the growing digital divide between those who have access to the internet and those who do not. In recent years, he has been working on a project called Solid, which aims to give individuals greater control over their personal data. Rather than storing information on the servers of big tech companies, Solid allows users to keep their data in personal online vaults called pods. Whether this vision will gain widespread adoption remains to be seen, but Berners-Lee remains optimistic that technology can still be a force for good in the world.",

     audio:"Good morning, everyone. Today I would like to talk to you about the history and future of video gaming. The first commercially successful video game was Pong, which was released way back in 1972. It was a simple table tennis simulation, but it captured the public imagination and launched an entirely new industry. By the early 1980s, home consoles like the Atari 2600 had become hugely popular, although the market suffered a major crash in 1983 due to an oversupply of poor-quality games. It was Nintendo that revived the industry with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. The console introduced iconic characters such as Mario and Zelda, who remain beloved to this day. The 1990s saw fierce competition between Nintendo and Sega before Sony entered the market with the PlayStation in 1994. This was a turning point because the PlayStation attracted an older audience and helped establish gaming as mainstream entertainment rather than just a children's hobby. The early 2000s brought online gaming, which allowed players from different countries to compete against each other in real time. Today, the gaming industry generates more revenue than the film and music industries combined. Looking ahead, many experts believe that cloud gaming will become the dominant model, meaning players will stream games over the internet rather than buying physical discs or downloading large files. Virtual reality is another area of rapid growth, although the technology still needs to become more affordable and comfortable before it achieves mass adoption.",

     passage:"In the remote highlands of Ethiopia, a remarkable conservation success story is unfolding. The Ethiopian wolf, one of the rarest canids on Earth, was once on the very brink of extinction. With fewer than 500 individuals remaining in the wild, the species faced threats from disease, habitat loss, and conflict with local farmers. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of a dedicated team of conservationists, the population has stabilised and is now showing signs of slow but steady recovery. The Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme, established in the early 1990s, has adopted a multi-faceted approach to saving the species. One of its most successful initiatives has been a vaccination campaign targeting domestic dogs in the region, which are the primary carriers of rabies and canine distemper, diseases that have historically devastated wolf populations. Volunteers trek into remote mountain communities to administer vaccines, a task that requires considerable physical endurance and cultural sensitivity. The programme has also worked closely with local communities, recognising that conservation cannot succeed without the support of the people who share the landscape with the wolves. Farmers have been encouraged to adopt livestock management practices that reduce conflict with predators, and educational outreach programmes in schools aim to foster a sense of pride in the wolves among younger generations. One particularly innovative scheme pays local people to act as wolf ambassadors, monitoring packs in their area and reporting any signs of disease or disturbance. This has created a sense of shared ownership over the conservation effort. Despite these successes, challenges remain. Climate change is pushing the wolves higher into the mountains as temperatures rise, shrinking their already limited habitat. Agricultural expansion also continues to encroach on wolf territory. The future of the Ethiopian wolf is by no means secure, but the progress made so far offers a powerful reminder that dedicated, community-based conservation can make a real difference.",

The project focuses on rewilding, which essentially means restoring land to its natural state by reintroducing native species and removing human interventions. Our main achievement so far has been the reintroduction of the Eurasian beaver, which had been extinct in Britain for over four hundred years. The beavers were first released in a carefully selected river valley in 2009. Since then, they have built an extensive network of dams, which has had a remarkable effect on the local ecosystem. The dams slow the flow of water, reducing the risk of flooding downstream. They also create wetland habitats that support a wide variety of other wildlife, including otters, dragonflies, and numerous bird species. We have also planted over two hundred thousand native trees, mainly birch, oak, and Scots pine, to replace the commercial plantations that once dominated the landscape. The early results have been extremely encouraging. Biodiversity surveys show that the number of species in the area has increased by around forty percent since the project began. Of course, not everyone has been supportive. Some local sheep farmers were initially opposed to the reintroduction of beavers, fearing damage to their land. However, we have worked hard to address their concerns, and most now accept that the benefits to the wider community outweigh any inconvenience.",

     passage:"Finland consistently ranks among the top countries in the world for educational achievement, and yet its approach to schooling could hardly be more different from that of most other nations. Finnish children do not start formal education until the age of seven, a full one or two years later than in many comparable countries. There is minimal standardised testing, no school league tables, and homework is kept to a minimum. The school day is shorter than in most countries, and children are given frequent breaks, including at least fifteen minutes of outdoor play for every forty-five minutes of instruction. Teachers in Finland are highly valued by society and enjoy the same professional prestige as doctors and lawyers. Entry into teacher training programmes is extremely competitive, with only about one in ten applicants being accepted. All teachers must hold a master's degree, and they are given considerable freedom to design their own curricula and choose their own teaching methods. This level of trust and autonomy is seen as a key factor in attracting high-calibre graduates to the profession. Another distinctive feature of the Finnish system is its emphasis on equality. There are no private schools, and the gap between the highest and lowest performing students is among the smallest in the world. Additional support is provided early to any student who falls behind, rather than waiting for problems to accumulate. Free school meals, free textbooks, and free healthcare are available to all students. Critics have questioned whether the Finnish model can be transplanted to other countries with larger populations, greater cultural diversity, or different economic conditions. Finnish educators themselves are cautious about making sweeping claims, acknowledging that their system has evolved over decades and is deeply rooted in Finnish culture and values. Nevertheless, the Finnish experience offers valuable lessons about the importance of teacher quality, student well-being, and equity in education.",

     audio:"Hello, everyone. My name is Dr Sarah Chen, and I am here to talk to you about the benefits of learning a musical instrument. Research consistently shows that studying music has a profoundly positive effect on brain development, particularly in children. When you play an instrument, multiple areas of the brain are activated simultaneously, including those responsible for motor control, auditory processing, and emotional regulation. A landmark study conducted at the University of Southern California found that children who received music lessons for two years showed measurable improvements in reading ability and mathematical reasoning compared to a control group. Interestingly, the benefits were most pronounced among children from lower-income families. Adults can benefit too. A study published in the Journal of Neuroscience demonstrated that older adults who had played an instrument for at least ten years performed significantly better on memory tests than those who had never played. Learning music also helps develop discipline and patience, since mastering an instrument requires thousands of hours of practice. Perhaps most importantly, music provides a powerful outlet for self-expression and can be a source of great joy and fulfilment throughout a person's life. Many professional musicians describe the experience of performing as deeply meditative, a state of total absorption in the present moment.",

     passage:"Sleep is one of the most fundamental human needs, yet it is also one of the most neglected. In our fast-paced modern world, millions of people regularly sacrifice sleep in order to meet work deadlines, socialise, or simply scroll through their phones late into the night. The consequences of chronic sleep deprivation are far more serious than most people realise. Research has linked insufficient sleep to a wide range of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and weakened immune function. A study published in the journal Nature found that people who consistently slept fewer than six hours per night were four times more likely to catch a common cold than those who slept seven hours or more. The effects on mental health are equally alarming. Sleep-deprived individuals show reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for rational thinking and emotional control. This helps explain why tired people are more irritable, more impulsive, and more prone to making poor decisions. Matthew Walker, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, has described sleep as the single most effective thing we can do for our brain and body health. In his influential book, he argues that no aspect of our biology is left unscathed by sleep deprivation. Despite this overwhelming evidence, society continues to glorify busyness and treat sleep as an expendable luxury. Many successful business leaders boast about surviving on just four or five hours a night, sending a dangerous message to the rest of us. Schools, too, have been criticised for starting too early, forcing teenagers to attend classes at a time when their biological clocks are telling them to sleep. Some progressive schools have experimented with later start times and reported improvements in attendance, behaviour, and academic performance. The message from science is clear: we ignore sleep at our peril.",

     audio:"Good afternoon. I am Dr James Morton, and today I want to share with you some recent findings about the relationship between gut health and mental well-being. For decades, scientists treated the brain and the gut as entirely separate systems. However, groundbreaking research over the past ten years has revealed that the two are intimately connected through what we now call the gut-brain axis. Your gut contains approximately one hundred trillion bacteria, collectively known as the gut microbiome. These bacteria play a crucial role not only in digestion but also in regulating mood and behaviour. Studies have shown that people with a diverse range of gut bacteria tend to have lower rates of depression and anxiety. Conversely, an imbalanced microbiome has been associated with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and even autism. One of the most fascinating experiments in this field was conducted at University College Cork in Ireland. Researchers fed a specific strain of probiotic bacteria to a group of mice and observed significant reductions in stress-related behaviour. When the vagus nerve, which connects the gut to the brain, was severed, the beneficial effects disappeared entirely. This confirmed that the gut communicates directly with the brain through this neural pathway. So what can you do to improve your gut health? The single most important factor is diet. Eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and fermented foods promotes microbial diversity. Processed foods and excessive sugar, on the other hand, tend to reduce it.",

     passage:"Street art has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past few decades. Once dismissed as mere vandalism, it is now widely celebrated as a legitimate and often powerful form of artistic expression. The most famous figure in this movement is undoubtedly Banksy, the anonymous British artist whose satirical works have appeared on walls and buildings around the world. Banksy's pieces typically combine dark humour with sharp political commentary, addressing themes such as war, consumerism, and surveillance. One of his most iconic works, Girl with Balloon, was famously shredded moments after being sold at auction for over one million pounds in 2018, in what many interpreted as a comment on the commercialisation of art. The partly shredded piece, renamed Love is in the Bin, subsequently sold for even more. What makes Banksy so compelling is not just the quality of the art but the mystery surrounding the artist's identity. Despite decades of speculation, Banksy has never been definitively identified, and this anonymity has only added to the allure. Some critics argue that Banksy's work, while undeniably clever, has become part of the very establishment it claims to criticise. Banksy prints now sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds, and cities actively promote their Banksy works as tourist attractions. In a sense, the art world has co-opted the rebel. Others counter that Banksy's ability to operate outside the traditional gallery system, creating art that is freely accessible to anyone walking past, remains genuinely subversive. The works do not require a ticket or a knowledge of art history to appreciate; they speak directly to ordinary people in ordinary places. Regardless of where one stands on this debate, there is no denying that Banksy has changed the way we think about art, public space, and the boundaries between the two.",

     audio:"Good evening, and welcome to tonight's talk on the history of photography. The story begins in 1826, when a French inventor named Joseph Nicephore Niepce produced the first permanent photograph. The image, which showed the view from his workshop window, required an exposure time of approximately eight hours. Over the following decades, the technology improved rapidly. In 1839, Louis Daguerre introduced the daguerreotype, which could produce a sharp image in just a few minutes. Photography became commercially available for the first time, and portrait studios sprang up across Europe and America. By the 1880s, George Eastman had developed flexible roll film, and in 1888 he launched the Kodak camera with the famous slogan, You press the button, we do the rest. This democratised photography, making it accessible to ordinary people rather than just professionals. The twentieth century brought colour photography, the instant camera pioneered by Polaroid, and eventually the digital revolution. The first digital camera was actually built by an engineer at Kodak named Steve Sasson in 1975. Ironically, Kodak's management failed to recognise the potential of digital technology, and the company eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Today, most photographs are taken on smartphones, and an estimated 1.4 trillion images are captured worldwide every year. The sheer volume raises questions about whether we are truly experiencing our lives or merely documenting them.",

     passage:"In 1971, psychologist Philip Zimbardo conducted one of the most controversial experiments in the history of social science. The Stanford Prison Experiment, as it became known, was designed to investigate how ordinary people behave when placed in positions of power or subjugation. Twenty-four male university students, all deemed psychologically healthy, were randomly assigned to play the role of either guards or prisoners in a simulated prison set up in the basement of a building at Stanford University. The experiment was planned to last two weeks but had to be abandoned after just six days due to the alarming behaviour that emerged. The guards, who had been given uniforms, mirrored sunglasses, and wooden batons, quickly began to abuse their authority. They subjected the prisoners to humiliating punishments, forced them to perform degrading tasks, and denied them sleep. Several prisoners suffered emotional breakdowns and had to be released early. Zimbardo himself, who played the role of prison superintendent, later admitted that he had become so absorbed in the experiment that he failed to intervene when he should have. The experiment has been cited countless times as evidence of the power of situational forces to override individual morality. The message seemed clear: under the right circumstances, anyone is capable of cruelty. However, in recent years, the experiment has come under intense scrutiny. Researchers who reviewed Zimbardo's original recordings discovered that the guards had been given much more direction than was originally claimed. Some participants have since stated that they were acting rather than genuinely losing control. Critics argue that the experiment tells us more about the influence of authority figures than about human nature itself. Despite these criticisms, the Stanford Prison Experiment remains a landmark study. It continues to provoke important discussions about ethics in research, the nature of obedience, and the thin line between civilised behaviour and brutality.",

     audio:"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining me today. I am going to talk about the fascinating science of body language. Research tells us that more than half of all communication is non-verbal, meaning that our gestures, facial expressions, and posture often say more than our words. One of the pioneers in this field was the American psychologist Paul Ekman, who spent decades studying facial expressions across different cultures. His most important finding was that there are seven basic emotions, happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, contempt, and disgust, that are expressed through the same facial muscles regardless of cultural background. This suggests that these expressions are innate rather than learned. Ekman's work has had many practical applications. He developed a system called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which catalogues every possible movement of the facial muscles. This tool has been used by law enforcement agencies to help detect when someone is lying. Interestingly, Ekman found that genuine smiles, known as Duchenne smiles, involve the muscles around the eyes as well as the mouth, whereas fake smiles only use the mouth. This is why we instinctively feel that someone's smile does not look quite right, even if we cannot explain why. More recently, researchers have been exploring how body language affects not just how others perceive us, but how we perceive ourselves. A well-known study by social psychologist Amy Cuddy suggested that adopting expansive postures, standing tall with your arms spread wide, can actually increase feelings of confidence.",

     passage:"The ancient city of Pompeii, buried under metres of volcanic ash when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, is one of the most extraordinary archaeological sites in the world. The eruption, which occurred with devastating speed, killed an estimated two thousand people and preserved the city almost exactly as it was on that fateful day. When systematic excavations began in the eighteenth century, archaeologists were astonished to find intact buildings, vivid frescoes, and even the preserved forms of human bodies caught in their final moments. The site has provided an unparalleled window into daily life in the Roman Empire. We know what Pompeians ate, how they decorated their homes, what games their children played, and how they conducted business. Graffiti scratched onto walls reveals the everyday concerns and humour of ordinary Romans in a way that formal literary texts never could. One inscription reads: I am amazed, wall, that you have not yet collapsed under the weight of so much written nonsense. The excavation of Pompeii has not been without controversy, however. In the early days, treasure hunters removed valuable artefacts with little regard for their archaeological context. More recently, concerns have been raised about the deterioration of the site itself. Exposure to the elements, combined with the sheer number of tourists who visit each year, has taken a heavy toll. Several buildings have collapsed, and many frescoes are fading. The Italian government has invested hundreds of millions of euros in conservation efforts, but some experts believe that the site is being loved to death. A particularly heated debate centres on whether certain areas should be reburied for their own protection, even though this would deprive the public of access. It is a dilemma that neatly encapsulates the tension between preservation and public engagement that runs through all of archaeology.",

Zheng He was a Chinese admiral who led seven major naval expeditions between 1405 and 1433, decades before the European Age of Exploration began. His fleet was extraordinary by any standard. The largest ships, known as treasure ships, were approximately 120 metres long, making them several times bigger than anything the Europeans would build for another century. On his first voyage alone, Zheng He commanded a fleet of over three hundred vessels carrying nearly 28,000 crew members. The expeditions visited more than thirty countries across Southeast Asia, India, the Persian Gulf, and the east coast of Africa. The primary purpose was not conquest but diplomacy. Zheng He carried luxury goods such as silk, porcelain, and tea, which he exchanged for exotic items including spices, precious stones, and even giraffes. These voyages established China as the dominant maritime power in the Indian Ocean. However, after Zheng He's death in 1433, the Chinese emperor ordered the fleet to be dismantled and banned further ocean voyages. The reasons for this dramatic reversal remain debated. Some historians argue that the cost of maintaining such an enormous fleet became unsustainable. Others suggest that Confucian scholars at court disapproved of foreign trade and naval expansion. Whatever the cause, China turned inward, and within a few decades, European explorers had filled the vacuum.",

     passage:"In 2012, scientists at CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, announced the discovery of the Higgs boson, a subatomic particle that had been predicted theoretically almost fifty years earlier. The discovery was hailed as one of the greatest achievements in the history of physics, confirming a crucial piece of the Standard Model, the theoretical framework that describes the fundamental forces and particles of the universe. The Higgs boson, sometimes called the God particle, a nickname that most physicists dislike, is responsible for giving other particles their mass. Without it, atoms could not form, and the universe as we know it would not exist. The search for the Higgs boson required the construction of the Large Hadron Collider, the most complex and expensive scientific instrument ever built. Located in a circular tunnel 27 kilometres in circumference beneath the border between France and Switzerland, the collider accelerates protons to nearly the speed of light before smashing them together. The collisions produce showers of subatomic particles, which are then analysed by enormous detectors. The sheer scale of the project is staggering. Thousands of scientists from over a hundred countries contributed to the effort, and the total cost has been estimated at approximately ten billion dollars. Some critics questioned whether such an enormous investment was justified for what might seem like an abstract discovery with no immediate practical application. Supporters counter that fundamental research has always been the foundation upon which practical technologies are eventually built. The World Wide Web, for example, was invented at CERN as a tool for physicists to share data, and it is difficult to imagine a technology that has had a greater impact on everyday life. The discovery of the Higgs boson answered one question but opened up many others. Physicists now hope that further experiments at the collider will shed light on mysteries such as dark matter, dark energy, and the fundamental nature of gravity.",

     audio:"Welcome, everyone. This afternoon I want to talk to you about one of the most ambitious scientific projects of the twentieth century: the Human Genome Project. Launched in 1990, the project set out to map every single gene in the human body. It was an international collaboration involving scientists from six countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and China. The project took thirteen years to complete and cost approximately three billion dollars. When the results were published in 2003, they revealed that the human genome contains roughly 20,000 genes, far fewer than scientists had predicted. Prior to the project, estimates had ranged from 80,000 to over 100,000 genes. This was one of the biggest surprises of the entire endeavour. The genome itself consists of approximately three billion base pairs of DNA, arranged in a specific sequence along 23 pairs of chromosomes. Remarkably, all humans share about 99.9 percent of their DNA, meaning that the entire range of human diversity, from eye colour to susceptibility to disease, is determined by just 0.1 percent of our genetic code. The Human Genome Project has transformed the field of medicine. Doctors can now use genetic testing to identify individuals who are at increased risk of developing conditions such as breast cancer or heart disease. Personalised medicine, in which treatments are tailored to an individual's genetic profile, is becoming an increasingly important part of healthcare.",

     passage:"Podcasting has quietly become one of the most popular forms of media in the world. What began in the early 2000s as a niche hobby for technology enthusiasts has grown into a billion-dollar industry, with an estimated 500 million listeners globally. Unlike traditional radio, podcasts are available on demand, allowing listeners to choose exactly what they want to hear and when they want to hear it. This flexibility has been a key factor in their appeal. The range of content available is staggering. There are podcasts on virtually every subject imaginable, from true crime and politics to philosophy, comedy, and niche hobbies like birdwatching. Some of the most successful podcasts have audiences that rival those of mainstream television programmes. Serial, a true crime podcast launched in 2014, is widely credited with bringing the medium to a mass audience. Its first series, which re-examined a murder case from 1999, was downloaded over 300 million times. For many creators, podcasting offers a level of creative freedom that is hard to find in other media. There are no advertisers dictating content in the early stages, no editors cutting material, and no time constraints beyond what the host chooses. This has allowed diverse and often underrepresented voices to find an audience. However, as the industry has grown, major media companies and streaming platforms have moved in, signing exclusive deals with popular hosts and investing heavily in original content. Some long-time podcast enthusiasts worry that this commercialisation threatens the independent spirit that made podcasting special in the first place. Others argue that investment from major players raises production quality and brings podcasts to a wider audience. The debate mirrors similar conversations that have taken place around other creative industries, from music to publishing, as they have been disrupted by digital technology.",

     audio:"Good morning, everyone. Today I am going to talk about the evolution of the book and what the future might hold for reading. The history of the book stretches back thousands of years. The earliest known examples of writing appeared in ancient Mesopotamia around 3400 BC, inscribed on clay tablets. The ancient Egyptians later developed papyrus scrolls, which were lighter and easier to transport. The codex, the format we would recognise as a book today, with bound pages and a cover, emerged in the Roman period, around the first century AD. However, books remained rare and expensive objects for centuries, since each one had to be copied by hand. Everything changed in 1440, when Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable type printing press in Mainz, Germany. This revolutionary technology made it possible to produce books quickly and cheaply for the first time. Within fifty years, an estimated twenty million volumes had been printed across Europe. The printing press is widely regarded as one of the most important inventions in human history, because it democratised knowledge and helped fuel the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Scientific Revolution. Fast forward to the twenty-first century, and the book is once again being transformed by technology. E-readers and audiobooks have changed the way many people consume literature. In 2023, audiobook sales surpassed two billion dollars globally for the first time. Despite frequent predictions that physical books would die out, however, print sales have actually remained remarkably stable, and in some markets have even grown.",

     passage:"In 2019, a young Swedish climate activist named Greta Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in a racing yacht to attend a United Nations climate summit in New York. She chose to sail rather than fly in order to highlight the carbon emissions produced by the aviation industry. The journey took fifteen days and attracted enormous media attention. Thunberg had first come to public notice the previous year, at the age of just fifteen, when she began a solitary protest outside the Swedish parliament, skipping school every Friday to demand action on climate change. Her School Strike for Climate movement quickly spread around the world, inspiring millions of young people to join protests in their own countries. Thunberg's message is simple but powerful: listen to the scientists. She has repeatedly accused world leaders of failing to take the climate crisis seriously, delivering blunt speeches at international summits that have both moved and angered her audience in equal measure. At the UN Climate Action Summit in 2019, she addressed delegates with the now-famous words: How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. Not everyone has been supportive, however. Some politicians have dismissed Thunberg as a naive teenager being manipulated by adults, while others have questioned whether school strikes are the most productive form of protest. Climate sceptics have attacked her personally, sometimes viciously, on social media. Thunberg has responded to such criticism with characteristic composure, arguing that the hostility she faces simply proves that her message is uncomfortable for those in power. Whether or not one agrees with her methods, it is difficult to deny that Thunberg has succeeded in placing climate change at the centre of global political debate in a way that decades of scientific reports and campaigning had failed to achieve.",

       {audio:"Woman: We have just come back from a holiday in Croatia. The old town in Dubrovnik was stunning, but it was so packed with tourists that it was hard to enjoy it. There were literally queues to take a photograph. Man: I have heard it has got much worse since that television series was filmed there. It is a shame when tourism spoils the very places people come to see.",q:"What problem did the woman encounter in Dubrovnik?",opts:["The weather was extremely poor","The town was too crowded with tourists","The accommodation was very expensive"],ans:1},
       {audio:"Man: I am thinking about taking a gap year to travel around South America. My parents are a bit worried about safety, but I have done a lot of research and I think if you take sensible precautions, the risks are manageable. Woman: I did exactly that ten years ago and it was the best decision I ever made. Just keep copies of all your documents and stay in touch regularly.",q:"What advice does the woman give?",opts:["He should not travel to South America alone","He should be sensible and keep in contact","He should take his parents with him"],ans:1},
       {audio:"Woman: Have you tried using one of those language translation apps when travelling abroad? Man: Yes, I used one in Tokyo last year. It was genuinely impressive. I held my phone up to a restaurant menu and it translated everything instantly. It is not perfect, but it takes away a lot of the stress of not speaking the local language.",q:"What does the man think about translation apps?",opts:["They are completely useless","They are helpful though not flawless","They are better than learning the language"],ans:1},
       {audio:"Man: I read that Bhutan measures its success not by GDP but by Gross National Happiness. They limit the number of tourists allowed in each year and charge a daily fee to protect their culture and environment. Woman: I think more countries should take that approach. Quality over quantity when it comes to tourism.",q:"What does the woman think about Bhutan's approach?",opts:["Other countries should consider a similar model","It is too restrictive and hurts the economy","The daily fee is unfair to tourists"],ans:0},
       {audio:"Woman: I had the most amazing experience volunteering at a wildlife sanctuary in South Africa. We helped look after orphaned elephants and assisted with anti-poaching patrols. It felt so much more meaningful than a typical beach holiday. Man: That sounds incredible. Was it expensive? Woman: Not really. You pay for your food and accommodation, but the work itself is unpaid, of course.",q:"Why did the woman enjoy her volunteer trip?",opts:["The beaches were beautiful","It felt more meaningful than a normal holiday","She earned a lot of money"],ans:1},
       {audio:"Man: One thing I always do when I travel is try the local street food. You learn so much about a culture through its food, and street vendors are usually incredibly friendly. Last year in Bangkok, I had the most incredible pad Thai from a tiny stall by the river. It cost less than a dollar. Woman: That is the best way to eat abroad, in my opinion. Avoid the tourist restaurants.",q:"Why does the man enjoy street food when travelling?",opts:["It is always safer than restaurant food","It provides cultural insight and is usually excellent","He does not like eating in restaurants"],ans:1},
       {audio:"Woman: I think responsible tourism starts with small choices. Using a reusable water bottle instead of buying plastic ones, choosing locally owned hotels over international chains, and learning a few words of the local language all make a difference. Man: Absolutely. And it often leads to a richer travel experience, too. When you make an effort with the local language, people open up to you much more.",q:"What do both speakers agree about?",opts:["Learning the local language is a waste of time","International hotel chains offer the best service","Small responsible choices enhance the travel experience"],ans:2},
       {audio:"Man: My family and I decided to take the train from London to the south of France instead of flying. It took longer, of course, but we went through the Channel Tunnel and then down through Paris. The children loved watching the scenery change, and we arrived feeling relaxed rather than jet-lagged. Woman: I would love to do that. There is something romantic about long train journeys.",q:"What did the man's family enjoy about travelling by train?",opts:["It was much cheaper than flying","The journey itself was part of the experience","The train had a swimming pool on board"],ans:1}

     audio:"Thank you for coming today. I want to talk about the rise of ecotourism and why it matters. Ecotourism is generally defined as responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people. The concept first gained traction in the 1980s, when environmentalists began to argue that tourism could be a tool for conservation rather than a cause of destruction. Costa Rica is often cited as the pioneer of ecotourism. In the 1990s, the country made a deliberate decision to market itself as a green destination, investing heavily in national parks and protected areas. Today, approximately twenty-five percent of Costa Rica's land is protected, one of the highest percentages in the world. The strategy has been remarkably successful. Tourism is now the country's largest source of foreign income, surpassing both coffee and banana exports. Kenya offers another compelling example. Community conservancies, where local people manage wildlife areas and receive a share of tourism revenue, have proved highly effective at reducing poaching. In the Maasai Mara region, elephant populations have increased by thirty percent since community-based conservation programmes were introduced. However, ecotourism is not without its challenges. Critics point out that the term is sometimes used as a marketing label rather than a genuine commitment to sustainability. So-called greenwashing, where companies make misleading environmental claims, is a growing problem. Travellers need to do their research and look for recognised certification schemes to ensure that their money is genuinely supporting conservation.",
