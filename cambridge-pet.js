   passage:"When Clara turned eighteen, she decided to travel around South America on her own. Her parents were worried at first, but Clara had been planning the trip for two years and had saved enough money from her weekend job at a bookshop. She bought a backpack, a guidebook, and a basic first-aid kit. Her first stop was Lima, Peru, where she stayed in a small hostel near the city centre. She was surprised by how friendly the other travellers were. On her second day, she met a group of students from Germany who were also travelling alone. They decided to visit Machu Picchu together. The journey took several hours by bus through the mountains, but the views were incredible. Clara had never seen anything so beautiful. After Peru, she travelled to Bolivia and then to Argentina. She tried local food everywhere she went and even learned to dance the tango in Buenos Aires. By the end of her three-month trip, Clara had visited six countries and made friends from all over the world. She returned home feeling more confident and independent than ever before.

   passage:"The way we listen to music has changed enormously over the past few decades. In the 1980s and 1990s, most people bought CDs from music shops. They would spend hours browsing through shelves and reading the back covers of albums before deciding what to buy. Then, in the early 2000s, digital music arrived and everything changed. Suddenly, people could download individual songs for a small fee instead of buying a whole album. Music shops began to close, and many musicians worried about how they would earn money. The biggest change, however, came with streaming services. These platforms allow users to listen to millions of songs for a monthly fee. Today, most young people have never bought a physical CD. They simply open an app on their phone and choose from a huge library of music. While this is incredibly convenient, some people argue that we have lost something important. When music is so easily available, we may not value individual albums as much as we used to. Artists also complain that streaming services do not pay them fairly. Despite these concerns, streaming continues to grow, and it is clear that this is how most people will listen to music in the future.",

Interviewer: People spend a lot of time looking at screens these days. Is that a problem? Dr. Patel: It depends. Screens themselves are not bad. The problem is when people use them too much, especially before going to sleep. The blue light from phones and tablets can make it harder to fall asleep. I always tell my patients to stop using screens at least one hour before bedtime. Interviewer: What about children? Dr. Patel: This is something I feel strongly about. Young children should not spend more than one hour a day on screens. They need to play outside, talk to other children, and use their imagination. I have seen children who spend five or six hours a day watching videos, and it really affects their concentration at school. Interviewer: Do you think technology has any benefits for health? Dr. Patel: Oh, absolutely. There are wonderful apps that help people exercise, track what they eat, and even monitor their heart rate.

   passage:"Ocean plastic pollution has become one of the most serious environmental problems of our time. Every year, approximately eight million tonnes of plastic waste enters the oceans. This plastic does not disappear. Instead, it breaks down into tiny pieces called microplastics, which are eaten by fish and other sea creatures. Scientists have found microplastics in the stomachs of animals living in the deepest parts of the ocean. The problem starts on land. Much of the plastic in the ocean comes from countries that do not have proper waste management systems. In these places, rubbish is often dumped in rivers, which carry it out to sea. However, wealthier countries also contribute to the problem by producing enormous amounts of single-use plastic, such as bottles, bags, and food packaging. Several solutions have been proposed. Some organisations are developing machines that can collect plastic from the ocean. Others believe we should focus on reducing the amount of plastic we produce in the first place. Many governments have introduced bans on certain single-use items, and some companies have started using alternative materials. Experts say that a combination of approaches is needed, and that everyone, from governments to individuals, has a role to play in solving this crisis.",

Every lunchtime, huge amounts of perfectly good food were being thrown away. It really upset me. Interviewer: So what did you do? Lisa: First, I talked to the head teacher about it. She was really supportive and helped me set up a team of volunteers. We started by measuring exactly how much food was being wasted each day. The results were shocking. We were throwing away nearly fifty kilos of food every week. Interviewer: That is a lot. How did you reduce it? Lisa: We introduced a system where students could choose smaller portions if they wanted. We also started a composting programme, so any food waste that could not be avoided was turned into compost for the school garden. We even set up a sharing table where students could leave food they did not want for others to take. Interviewer: Has it made a difference? Lisa: Definitely.

   passage:"Running has become one of the most popular forms of exercise in the world, and it is easy to see why. Unlike many sports, running requires very little equipment. All you need is a good pair of trainers, and you can run almost anywhere, at any time. Many people take up running because they want to lose weight or improve their fitness. However, research has shown that running has many other benefits as well. Regular runners report feeling less stressed and more energetic. Running releases chemicals in the brain called endorphins, which can improve your mood and help you sleep better. Some people describe feeling a sense of calm and happiness after a long run, which is often called the runner's high. Of course, running is not without its risks. Beginners sometimes do too much too soon and injure themselves. Experts recommend starting slowly and gradually increasing the distance. It is also important to warm up properly before running and to stretch afterwards. Good shoes are essential, as they protect your feet and joints from the impact of running on hard surfaces. For those who enjoy a challenge, there are thousands of running events held around the world each year, from short five-kilometre races to marathons and even ultra-marathons. Many of these events raise money for charity, which gives runners an extra reason to take part.",

Emma: Without a doubt, it is doing too much too soon. People get excited and they try to exercise every day, but their body is not ready for it. I always tell my clients to start with three sessions a week and build up slowly. Rest days are just as important as training days. Interviewer: Any other advice? Emma: Yes.

   passage:"Home schooling, where children are educated at home rather than at a traditional school, has been growing in popularity in many countries. There are several reasons why parents choose to educate their children at home. Some feel that schools do not provide enough individual attention, while others are unhappy with the quality of teaching. A few families choose home schooling because they travel frequently and need a more flexible approach to education. One of the main advantages of home schooling is that lessons can be adapted to suit each child's needs and interests. If a child is particularly interested in science, for example, they can spend more time on that subject. Children can also learn at their own pace without the pressure of keeping up with classmates. However, critics of home schooling point out some potential disadvantages. Children who are educated at home may have fewer opportunities to socialise with others their own age. They might miss out on team sports, group projects, and the everyday social interactions that happen naturally in a school environment. There are also concerns about whether parents have the necessary knowledge and skills to teach all subjects effectively. Despite these debates, research suggests that home-schooled children often perform as well as, or even better than, those who attend traditional schools. Many go on to succeed at university and in their careers.",

   passage:"The popularity of streaming services has had a huge impact on the film industry. In the past, people would go to the cinema to watch new films. Then, weeks or months later, the films would be released on DVD. Now, many films go straight to streaming platforms, and audiences can watch them from the comfort of their own homes on the same day they are released. This has caused a big debate in the film industry. Traditional filmmakers argue that films are designed to be seen on a large screen with professional sound systems. They believe that watching a film on a laptop or television does not provide the same experience. Some famous directors have even refused to make films for streaming services because they want their work to be shown in cinemas first. On the other hand, supporters of streaming say that it makes films more accessible. Not everyone lives near a cinema, and cinema tickets can be expensive, especially for families. Streaming allows people to watch a wide variety of films for a reasonable monthly fee. It has also given opportunities to smaller filmmakers who might struggle to get their films shown in cinemas. Despite the growth of streaming, cinema attendance has not disappeared entirely. Many people still enjoy the social experience of going to the cinema with friends or family.

   passage:"Cycling has experienced a remarkable rise in popularity over the past decade, particularly in cities around the world. Many urban areas have introduced bike-sharing schemes, where people can rent a bicycle for a short journey and return it at a different station. These schemes have made cycling a convenient option for people who do not own a bike. Cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen have been famous for their cycling culture for many years, but now cities such as London, Paris, and New York are catching up. New cycle lanes have been built to make roads safer for cyclists, and many employers now provide shower facilities and bike storage for staff who cycle to work. The health benefits of cycling are well known. It is an excellent form of cardiovascular exercise that is gentler on the joints than running. Regular cyclists have a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Cycling also has environmental benefits, as it produces no carbon emissions. Despite all these advantages, cycling in cities can still be dangerous. Accidents involving cyclists and motor vehicles are a serious concern, and many potential cyclists are put off by the risks. Campaigners continue to push for better infrastructure, including separated cycle lanes, lower speed limits, and improved driver education.

She had been running for years and offered to help me. Interviewer: How did you train? Mia: We started very slowly. At first, we would run for one minute and walk for two minutes, and repeat that for about twenty minutes. Gradually, I was able to run for longer periods.

Mia: Incredibly difficult. For the marathon, I was training five or six days a week. The long runs at the weekend were the hardest. I had to run for three or four hours at a time. There were many days when I wanted to give up, but my neighbour kept encouraging me. Interviewer: Tell us about the marathon itself.

   passage:"Street food has become a global phenomenon in recent years. While street food has always been popular in countries across Asia and Latin America, it is now booming in European and North American cities as well. Food markets and street food festivals are appearing everywhere, offering a wide variety of dishes from around the world. One reason for this trend is that people are becoming more adventurous with food. Social media has played a big role in this. People see photos of exciting dishes from other countries and want to try them. Street food markets bring these international flavours to local communities without the need to travel. Another factor is cost. Eating at a street food stall is usually much cheaper than going to a restaurant. You can get a delicious, freshly prepared meal for a fraction of the price. This makes it an attractive option for young people and families on a budget. Street food has also created opportunities for aspiring chefs. Starting a restaurant is expensive and risky, but setting up a street food stall requires much less investment. Many successful restaurants actually began as small street food businesses. However, there are some concerns about street food, including hygiene standards and the amount of waste produced by disposable plates and cups. Some markets are now addressing these issues by using biodegradable packaging and implementing strict food safety rules.",

   passage:"The way people work has changed dramatically in recent years, and one of the biggest shifts has been the move towards remote working. Before 2020, working from home was relatively uncommon. Most people travelled to an office every day. Then the global pandemic forced millions of workers to stay at home, and companies quickly discovered that many jobs could be done just as effectively from a spare bedroom or kitchen table. Now that restrictions have ended, many companies have adopted a hybrid model, where employees split their time between the office and home. Surveys show that most workers prefer this arrangement. They enjoy the flexibility of working from home but also value the social interaction that comes with going to the office. The commute is another factor. Many workers spent hours travelling to and from work every day, and working from home has given them that time back. However, remote working is not perfect. Some employees feel isolated and find it harder to separate their work life from their personal life. Younger workers, in particular, say they miss the opportunity to learn from more experienced colleagues. There are also concerns about career progression. Some managers admit that they are more likely to promote employees they see in the office every day. Despite these challenges, it is clear that remote working is here to stay.

   passage:"Cooking shows have become some of the most popular programmes on television. From competitive baking shows to celebrity chef specials, millions of viewers tune in every week to watch people prepare food. But do cooking shows actually encourage people to cook more at home? The answer is complicated. Research from a British university found that people who regularly watch cooking shows are more interested in food and more willing to try new recipes. They are also more likely to cook from scratch rather than buying ready meals. However, the same study found that watching cooking shows does not necessarily lead to healthier eating. Many of the recipes shown on television use large amounts of butter, cream, and sugar. The portions are often much bigger than what nutritionists would recommend. There is also the entertainment factor. Many viewers watch cooking shows in the same way they watch drama or comedy. They enjoy the competition and the personalities of the presenters, but they never actually try the recipes themselves. Some critics argue that cooking shows have turned food into entertainment rather than something practical. Despite this criticism, many chefs and food writers believe that cooking shows have had a positive overall effect. They have made cooking seem exciting and accessible. Twenty years ago, many young people could not cook at all. Today, thanks partly to television, cooking is seen as a valuable and enjoyable skill.",

   audio:"Interviewer: Welcome to the show. I am talking to chef Daniel, who has just opened a new restaurant. Daniel, tell us about it. Daniel: Thank you. The restaurant is called Green Table, and we specialise in plant-based food. Everything on the menu is one hundred percent vegan. Interviewer: Why did you decide to open a vegan restaurant? Daniel: I was working as a chef in a traditional restaurant for about ten years. I enjoyed it, but I became more and more interested in cooking without meat or dairy. I started experimenting at home, and I realised that vegan food could be just as delicious and satisfying as anything else. My wife, who has been vegan for years, encouraged me to take the next step. Interviewer: Was it risky? Daniel: Very risky. Many people told me it would not work. They said most people would not pay restaurant prices for vegan food. But I believed there was a market for it. We opened three months ago and we have been fully booked every weekend since. We have even had to hire extra staff. Interviewer: What is your most popular dish? Daniel: Our mushroom and truffle pasta is the favourite. People cannot believe it does not contain any cream. We use cashew nuts to create a rich, creamy sauce. Even customers who are not vegan say it is one of the best pasta dishes they have ever had. Interviewer: What are your plans for the future? Daniel: I would love to open a second restaurant eventually, maybe in a different city. But for now, I am focusing on making Green Table the best it can be.",
